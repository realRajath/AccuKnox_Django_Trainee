"""Question 2: Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.
   Answer: Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.
           Below code snippet supports the answer."""
