"""Question 1: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.
   Answer: Yes, Django signals synchronously executed by default
   Below is the supporting code snippet"""

from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import time

class MyClass(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyClass)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal started...")
    time.sleep(10)  # Adding delay to show it's synchronous
    print("Signal finished.")

# Creating an object to trigger the signal
obj = MyClass(name='Example')
obj.save()

print("Saved!")
